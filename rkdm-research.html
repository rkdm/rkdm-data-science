<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p>My research focuses on X-ray binaries, specifically on learning more about the &quot;quiescent&quot; state, which is defined as the time between outbursts, when X-ray emission is lower and relatively consistent over time. X-ray binaries (XRBs) have traditionally been discovered when they have an outburst, and a lot of research has focused on characterizing the various stages of these outbursts. However, XRBs spend most of their time in quiescence. It is therefore crucial that we understand quiescence, since this is where all outbursts begin.</p>

<p>My other research interests include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Solar physics, especially anything to do with sunspots</li>
    <li>The history of astronomy, especially astronomy in medieval europe before the use of the telescope</li>
    <li>Sundials, quadrants, astrolabes, and other pre-telescopic instruments</li>
    <li>Making sure astronomical data is preserved and maintained in accessible formats for future researchers</li>
</ul>
